- 1. Write a program using the Verlet velocity algorithm to solve the two-dimensional molecular motion equation.
- 2. Write a two-dimensional program with periodic boundary conditions for a cell of size L.
- 3*. Perform a molecular dynamics simulation of a single-atom system at a fixed temperature. The cell length is 10. The number of atoms in the cell is 64. The atomic mass is 1. Use the Lennard-Jones potential, where ε=σ=1, with periodic boundary conditions. The initial positions are randomly distributed, and the initial velocities are randomly distributed between [-1, 1]. The system temperature is fixed at 0.85, perform a molecular dynamics simulation. Provide the relationship between kinetic energy and time, and analyze the velocity distribution after the system reaches equilibrium.
